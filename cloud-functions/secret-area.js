//cloud function:
// We created this JS function.

//Netlify takes the functions we have written, and sends it to 
//a private and trusted environment over on Amazon web services.
//Since then, Netlify sets up a convenient URL.
// Whenever someone sends a request to the URL, netlify tells amazon servers to run
// and execute that.
// 3rd parties, including malicious users, will never the code we type here.
// The public will only see the response we respond to.


// cloud function?
//Not executed on web browser, static file host or a server.
// to test the data a user sent to a URL...
// different results ->different responses
